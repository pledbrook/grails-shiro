Once the plugin is installed and you have run the [shiro-quick-start|Scripts] script you will soon discover that it is working,
you will discover this when you execute @grails run-app@ and find that you cannot access any controllers*.  We examine the details
 of why and how this happened later but for now lets create a user within the application BootStrap so we can use the application.

{code}
import org.apache.shiro.crypto.hash.Sha256Hash
class BootStrap {
    def init = { servletContext ->
        def user = new ShiroUser(username: "user123", passwordHash: new Sha256Hash("password").toHex())
        user.addToPermissions("\*:\*:\*")
        user.save()
    }
}
{code}

{note}
\* The default configuration does not protect anything other than controllers, do not be surprised if you were able to view
non-controller resources without logging in.
